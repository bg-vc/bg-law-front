### Text Constants Structure
All text content has been extracted into centralized constant files under `src/constants/text/pages/`:

```typescript
// Common structure across all pages
export const PAGE_TEXT = {
  META: {
    TITLE: string,
    DESCRIPTION: string,
  },
  HERO: {
    TITLE: string,
    DESCRIPTION: string,
  },
  // Page-specific sections
  SECTIONS: {
    // Various sections with their content
  }
}
```

### Pages with Extracted Text
1. **Home** (`home.ts`)
   - Meta information
   - Hero section
   - Features list
   - Statistics
